However, if you become a registered Site user, some information on our membership lists, such as your name and mailing address, may be exchanged with other organizations. Members may opt out of such membership list exchanges by following the opt-out procedures described below. If you submit an application for employment through our careers page hosted by a third party, your data will be provided directly to such third party provider and Parallel will also share your information with other organizations necessary to perform the purpose for which you provided the data, namely, to verify employment and education history, perform background checks, and perform other necessary functions related to reviewing and responding to an application for employment.</p>

While we try our best to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
            <p><strong>6. IP Addresses-</strong><br>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you access the Internet. This number may be the same each time you access the Internet, or it may change. Like other Internet sites, Parallel uses IP addresses to collect aggregate information about numbers of visitors and Site usage. The address is logged on our server when your computer requests information from Parallel. Parallel reserves the right, in rare instances, to use IP addresses to identify individuals who threaten our site, service, or users.</p>
            <p><strong>7. EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”)</strong><br>Parallel Wireless, Inc. is headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire, United States with offices in India, Israel, and the United Kingdom.  Where required, Parallel Wireless complies with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws.</p>
            <p><strong>How we use personal data</strong><br>In addition to Section 3 above, Parallel will use your personal data based on:<br>

                Our legitimate business interests: For example, when you provide your information to us in connection with marketing offers or solutions feedback. You may have the right to object to this use of your personal data. Please review the “Opting Out” and “Data Subject Rights” sections for more information.<br>
                Contract: For example, we may process personal information of business contacts to establish a contract for goods or services between you and Parallel, maintain contact points, and send you invoices for ordered goods or services.<br>
                Legal obligation: For example, when it is reasonably necessary for Parallel to retain your personal data to comply with a legal obligation on Parallel, such as tax laws, export control compliance, or to exercise or defend our legal rights.<br>
                Consent: We will rely on your consent to retain and use your personal data if no other basis is relevant. You may have the right to object or withdraw your consent. Please review the “Opting Out” and “Data Subject Rights” sections for more information.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Data Transfers</strong><br>To provide our products and services, including employment services, Parallel may transfer data across Parallel’s affiliate companies in different geographic locations. When we transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S., we do so in compliance with appropriate safeguards, such as signing E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Data Subject Rights</strong><br>Your local law may provide you with rights regarding the distribution and use of your personal data. For example, GDPR gives residents of the EU rights that they can exercise free of charge, including:<br>

                Right to correct your personal information<br>
                Right to withdraw consent<br>
                Right to access your personal data<br>
                Right to data portability<br>
                Right to data deletion<br>
                Right to object to processing</p><br>

            <p><strong>8.Notice to California Residents</strong><br>Except with regard to the alternative detailed below, residents of the State of California have the right to request a list of all third parties to which a company conducting business in California has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise this choice.<br>

                Parallel qualifies for this alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy policy and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. We are not required, therefore, to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p><br>

            <p><strong>10. Other Websites</strong><br>If you suspect that we have handled your personal information in a manner that doesn’t comply with the Privacy Policy, please contact us by e-mailing info@parallelwireless.com.</p><br>
            <p><strong>11. Contacting Us</strong><br>If you no longer wish to receive communications from Parallel, you may email us at info@parallelwireless.com or click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email sent to you by Parallel. You should know that opting out or unsubscribing from our site does not delete your personal information from our system, which may exist in backup or disaster-recovery files. Even if you opt out, we may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, renewal of your membership, updates regarding the status of your application for employment, contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken.</p>
            <p><strong>12. Amendments</strong><br>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time and in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time, but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Privacy Policy the date it was last updated. .
