                    scheduling in one intelligent solution to reduce complexity and costs of deploying multi-vendor,
                    multi-technology HetNets. HNG is the industry’s first carrier-grade, NFV/SDN-based, 3GPP compliant
                    RAN orchestrator that unifies any technology and any vendor RAN to present it as one common
                    interface to the core. HNG logically sits between the RAN and core and abstracts the RAN on any COTS
                    hardware while making RAN self-configuring, self-optimizing, and self-healing; this also enables HNG
                    to reduce signaling/paging load on the core.</p>

                <p class="p4">Parallel Wireless, the pioneer in making cellular network deployments and maintenance as
                    easy and cost-effective as enterprise Wi-Fi, and Saguna Networks, a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)
                    pioneer have teamed up on this reimagined content caching solution. The License Assisted Backhaul
                    and Unlicensed Assist technologies on Parallel Wireless CWS have been proven as key enablers in
                    delivering access to remote villages in the UK. They now allow mobile operators to complement the
                    backhaul capacity of their existing macro infrastructure, add resilience with SDN-enabled mesh
                    fabric, and accelerate delivery of mobile content with MEC running as a Virtualized Network Function

                    maintenance. In addition to demonstrating interoperability, this trial network will also address the

                <p class="p4">Backhaul is considered to be in the top three challenges in deploying RAN. With the
                    traditional approach, bringing backhaul to a site takes a long time and requires a substantial
                    upfront investment because in order to deliver the highest speed possible, Service Providers need
                    very expensive backhaul fiber. Backhaul technology requirements should focus firstly on the
                    flexibility of using different types of backhaul – whatever is available at the potential deployment
                    site, secondly, be easily configurable for mass deployments of small cells, and thirdly, be
                    resilient to any type of failures. These three requirements of backhaul flexibility, automation and
                    resilience were taken into consideration when Parallel Wireless developed their backhaul solution.
